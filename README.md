# React starter kit

A very simple starter kit for using React and CSS Modules.

No doubt there are packages you could remove (i.e. Immutable, Ramda); I pulled this out of a production project. I’ll strip this down to a barer minimum soon. Till I do, sorry for the mess.

I wrote this using stable node which at the time of writing is v6.3.0. It might work with earlier versions but makes use of some bleeding edge stuff (webpack 2) so don’t bet the farm on it.
